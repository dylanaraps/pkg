**OS**

- Added support for Bedrock Linux. [**@paradigm**](https://github.com/paradigm)
- Added support for Namib GNU/Linux. [**@arisinfenix**](https://github.com/arisinfenix)
- Added support for Reborn OS. [**@iandrewt**](https://github.com/iandrewt)
- Added support for OpenMandriva Lx. [**@konimex**](https://github.com/konimex)
- Added support for Star. [**@arisinfenix**](https://github.com/arisinfenix)
- Added support for BlueLight OS.
- Added support for Huayra Linux.
- Added support for Pentoo.

**Highlights**

- [ASCII] Added support for command output. You can now use whatever terminal commands you like as the ASCII art.

```sh
# Use fortune and cowsay as ascii art.
neofetch --ascii "$(fortune|cowsay -W 30)"

# use figlet as ascii art.
neofetch --ascii "$(figlet -w 30 hello world)"
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ozoXAvz.jpg" alt="scrot" height="400px">

- Added a new "simple" mode. You can now use neofetch for scripting by getting it to output individual info functions in plain text.

```sh
# Example:
neofetch uptime --uptime_shorthand tiny
> uptime: 32m

# Example:
neofetch uptime disk wm memory
> uptime: 33 mins
> disk (/): 212G / 235G (96%)
> wm: Openbox
> memory: 1215MiB / 7881MiB

# This can be used in bars and scripts like so:
memory="$(neofetch memory)"; memory="${memory##*: }"

# For multiple outputs at once (each line of info in an array):
# Much faster than running neofetch multiple times.
IFS=$'\n' read -d "" -ra info < <(neofetch memory uptime wm)
info=("${info[@]##*: }")
```

<h1><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JFxwJtU.png" alt="logo" height="100px"></h1>

This release bumps the version number up to `4.0.0` as it contains major
changes to how Neofetch is packaged and installed.

The entirety of Neofetch is now contained within a single executable.
Everything has been in-lined. Installing Neofetch is now as easy as
downloading the script and running it.

Those using distributions with an outdated Neofetch version in their repos
can now easily install the latest version themselves.

Thanks to those who contributed this time around and thanks to those who
discussed proposed changes in the bug tracker and Discord. I appreciate
it. :+1:


## Discord

Neofetch now has a Discord server. Come and join the discussion!

## [3.1.0] - 2017-04-25

Hi, It's been quite a while since the last release. I've been extremely busy with university and I finally found some time to flag a new release. (I've been meaning to do this for a few weeks now)

Though I haven't worked on Neofetch as much as I'd have liked, most of the changes this time round come from some familiar faces as well as some new contributors! Thanks to everyone for contributing, I appreciate it.

## [3.0] - 2017-01-23

This is another large release containing over `550` commits from 7 contributors. Due to the size and large amount of changes made this release expect at least one minor release to fix any bugs that come up.

The version number has been bumped to `3.0` due to the large amount of breaking changes introduced this update. I've added backwards compatibility for all of the new changes but there may still be some breakage. I highly recommend starting with a new config to avoid any issues that may arise.

Neofetch now supports displaying images using `catimg`, `libcaca` and `jp2a`. See this wiki page for screenshots. https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/wiki/Image-Backends

Thanks to everyone who contributed this release, there were a lot of new faces this time around. :)

## IRC

Neofetch now has an IRC channel at `#neofetch` on Freenode. If you have any questions, issues or ideas feel free to join the IRC channel and I'll be happy to assist you. I know that we've already got the Gitter chat but hopefully this makes things easier for those without a GitHub account. :)

[![Freenode](https://img.shields.io/badge/%23neofetch-%20on%20Freenode-brightgreen.svg)](http://irc.lc/freenode/neofetch)

## Collaborators

I have given collaborator access to both **[@konimex](https://github.com/konimex)** and **[@iandrewt](https://github.com/iandrewt)**. In short this allows them to push directly to the master branch of the repo, manage the issue tracker and also merge pull requests. They've been a huge help the past year so this made sense to me.

## OS
- Added support for AIX.
- Added support for AntiX.
- Added support for GNU/kFreeBSD.
- Added support for Gentoo FreeBSD.
- Added support for GrombyangOS.
- Added support for Joyent SmartOS.
- Added support for Mer.
- Added support for MINIX.
- Added support for MX.
- Added support for Open Source Media Center (OSMC).
- Added support for SalentOS.
- Added support for TrueOS.
- Added support for Windows (MSYS2).

## General
- The default config file is now installed to `/etc/neofetch/config` and acts as a system-wide config file for Neofetch. Editing this file will make the changes available to all users on the system. Those packaging Neofetch **without** using the Makefile will need to make changes to support this.
- The Makefile was rewritten to remove GNU-isms.
- Removed executable permission from config files. BASH can source them even if they're un-executable.
- Travis now runs [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) on every commit and pull request.
  - We've had to exclude around 10 lint errors, see this wiki page for why we did this:
  - https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/wiki/Shellcheck-Exclusions
- Neofetch now supports relative path values when specifying the location to images, ascii files and config files.
  - For example, `neofetch --w3m Pictures/Wallpapers/10.jpg` and `neofetch --w3m 10.jpg` now work.
- Optimize usage of `get_de()`, `get_wm()` and `get_term().
  - We were calling these multiple times, we now only run them once and check to see if they were run previously.
- Optimize info caching, only check for cache files in functions that use caching.
- The manpage is now generated using `help2man`. `help2man` parses the output of `--help` and `--version` to create a manpage. This ensures that our manpage stays 1:1 with the script documentation. We actually found a lot of outdated info in the old manpage thanks to this.
  - A new flag was added called `--gen-man` which generates a neofetch manpage in your current directory.
- Delete most of `info()` and instead call `prin()`.
  - This removes a lot of duplicate code between `info()` and `prin()`.
- Remove `printf` subshells and instead use `printf -v` to declare the variables.
- Fixed artifacts when using line-breaks in TTYs.
- All errors are now sent to `stderr`.
- Renamed `XFCE` --> `Xfce`. **[@gavinhungry](https://github.com/gavinhungry)**
- Cleanup `main()`.
- Renamed `old_flags()` --> `old_options()`.

## Info

**Shell**<br \>
- [Fish] Fixed memory leak caused by Fish.
- Added support for `xonsh`.
- Fixed version output on `ksh`.
- Rewrote the function to remove duplicate code.

**Uptime**<br \>
- Moved duplicate code to a function.
- Changed `$uptime_shorthand` to `on` by default.

**Desktop Environment**<br \>
- Fixed issues where MATE wouldn't be detected properly.
- Added fallback to `$DESKTOP_SESSION`, `$MATE_DESKTOP_SESSION_ID` and `$GNOME_DESKTOP_SESSION_ID`.
- Hide Desktop Environment if it matches Window Manager.

**CPU**<br \>
- [Linux] Don't simplify `cpufreq` speed option names for no reason.
- [Linux] Fixed issues with CPU name detection for architectures other than x86/amd64/ARM.
- [NetBSD] Remove case statement in favor of 1 line test.
- Simplify check for low CPU speeds.
- Expanded `cpu_temp` to take the values `C` and `F`. This means you can now display the CPU temperature as Fahrenheit.

**CPU Usage**<br \>
- Added Haiku cores command.
- Updated Linux and macOS commands to the match the commands in the `get_cpu()` function.

**GPU**<br \>
- [Linux] Each GPU is now printed on a separate line.
- [Linux] Added `--gpu_type` / `$gpu_type` which lets you display `all`, `dedicated` or `integrated` GPUs.

**Memory**<br \>
- [Solaris] Fixed inaccurate used memory size.

**Resolution**<br \>
- [Windows] Declare variables locally to fix conflicts in other functions.

**~~Birthday~~ Install Date**<br \>
- Renamed `get_birthday()` -- > `get_install_date()`
- Removed all `date` command usage from `get_install_date()`.
- Added a new function called `convert_time()` which takes the time stamped `ls` output and converts it to a pretty format. The function only uses bash so its much faster than calling `date`. This makes things simple and keeps the output consistent across all Operating Systems. Example: `2016-12-06 16:58:58.000000000` --> `Tue 06 Dec 2016 4:58 PM`
- Added an option so users can choose between using 24-hour and 12-hour time format
- `get_install_date()` will detect which `ls` program is being used instead of hardcoding them per OS.

**Disk**<br \>
- Rewrote function from scratch.
  - The function is `40` lines smaller than before and works on all [1] versions of `df` we tested on [2].
- Added the option/flag `disk_show` which allows you to specify which disks, mount points or directories to show the disk info of. (One per line)
- Added the option/flag `disk_subtitle` which allows you to specify how we label each disk. (Mount point or Disk name)
- Removed all percentage calculation since `df` already provides us with the percentage.
- Warn the user if `df` isn't installed.
- Fixed broken output if `df` wasn't installed but the function was enabled.

[1] The function doesn't work on Haiku since their `df` is wildly non-standard. (The output format and flags are 100% different from all of the other `df` versions floating around.)

[2] Tested on `GNU`, `Busybox`, `BSD`, `Solaris` and `macOS` `df` versions.

**Theme**<br \>
- [KDE] Don't display GTK Themes if KDE is detected.
- [KDE] If `kde[0-9]-config` isn't found, try and look for `$HOME/.kde`.

**Window Manager Theme**<br \>
- Fixed WM Theme not detected on MATE. **[@mstraube](https://github.com/mstraube)**
- Fixed WM Theme detection on KDE. **[@mstraube](https://github.com/mstraube)**

- Added support for Mopidy. **[@d3rrial](https://github.com/d3rrial)**
- [cmus] Simplify block and fix `artistsort` bug.
- Removed `state` detection.
- Removed duplicate `dbus-send` commands. **[@mstraube](https://github.com/mstraube)**
- Hide output if no song is playing.
- Enforce order `artist - title` in `get_song_dbus()`. **[@mstraube](https://github.com/mstraube)**

**Terminal Font**<br \>
- Added support for Alacritty.
- Added support for Konsole. **[@mstraube](https://github.com/mstraube)**
- Added support for Sakura Terminal. **[@mstraube](https://github.com/mstraube)**
- Added support for Pantheon Terminal. **[@mstraube](https://github.com/mstraube)**
- Added support for deepin-terminal. **[@mstraube](https://github.com/mstraube)**
- [Termite] Fixed incorrect font chosen. **[@mstraube](https://github.com/mstraube)**
- [Termite] Also look at default config. **[@mstraube](https://github.com/mstraube)**

**Battery**<br \>
- [MacOS] Fixed issue where battery always appears as charging. **[@jorgegonzalez](https://github.com/jorgegonzalez)**

**Local IP**<br \>
- [BSD and Solaris] Merged the detection to Linux.
- [Windows] Support multiple interfaces.

**Color Blocks**<br \>
- Use `start++` instead of adding it manually after case. **[@konimex](https://github.com/konimex)**
- Fixed bug where color blocks wouldn't respect width in TTYs.
- Cursor positioning now takes `$block_height` into account.
- Fixed all artifacts in virtual consoles.
- Merged `$start` and `$end` into an array called `block_range`.
  - This makes the config option match the command-line flag `--block_range`.

## Images
- [iTerm2] Fixed blank images.
- Fixed bug where image mode would attempt to run in a TTY.
- All of the image/ascii backend handling was rewritten. Backend and Image/File/Directory selection is universal now and should make usage easier.
  - Added `catimg` backend.
  - Added `caca` backend.
  - Added `jp2a` backend.
  - `--image` has been replaced with `--backend`.
    - `--backend` takes `ascii`, `caca`, `catimg`, `jp2a`, `iterm2`, `off`, `tycat`, `w3m`.
  - Shortcut flags were added for easy picking of backends.
    - Each flag can take a file, image or directory as an argument.
    - For example: `neofetch --w3m /path/to/img.jpg` `neofetch --ascii /path/to/file`
    - `--w3m`
    - `--iterm2`
    - `--tycat`
    - `--ascii`
    - `--off`
    - `--catimg`
    - `--caca`
    - `--jp2a`
  - All image and ascii file selection has been replaced with the universal `--source`.
    - The value of `--source` can be any of the following:
    - `auto`, `ascii`, `wallpaper`, `/path/to/img`, `/path/to/ascii`, `/path/to/dir/`.
- Fixed bugs with image shuffle mode.

## Wallpaper
- Decode URI filenames.

## Ascii
- Simplified ascii file handling.
  - Removed a call to `tr` for those using `bash 3`.
  - Fixed distro detection issues.
  - Removed the assumption that `first word in distro --> ascii file name`

- Cleaned up config arg handling.


## [2.0.2] - 2016-12-07

This minor release fixes some issues related to new features added in 2.0. These issues weren't picked up in the time between 2.0 and 2.1 and another minor release is needed due to the Packages issue being rather important.

These issues were fixed by reverting the GPU caching and Packages optimizations. These issues occurred because not enough testing was done before these were implemented in master. In the future I'll take more care with testing these larger changes before they hit the master branch and I apologize for there being yet another release in one week.

I also want to apologize to those packaging Neofetch for this unexpected release.

## Info

**Packages**<br \>
- Fixed issue where package output was off by one.

**GPU**<br \>
- Fixed bug with `--gpu_brand` not working.

**Theme**<br \>
- [Cinnamon] Fixed incorrect information.


## [2.0.1] - 2016-12-06

This release of Neofetch fixes some important bugs that were found after 2.0 was release. This includes: Detection issues on CentOS and Linux Mint systems, Incorrect Memory usage on BSD, Linux GPU detection issues and more.

This release also includes a rewrite of the screenshot functions. You no longer have to set the program to use in your config. Neofetch now automatically finds and uses whatever screenshot tool is available on your machine.

See the screenshot section below for more info.

The `get_packages()` function was optimized. Neofetch's packages function works by detecting which package managers are installed on your system and then using a sum of those as the packages output.

Previously the function would call `wc -l` for every package manager, instead we now call `wc -l` only once at the end of the function.

Thanks for reporting these bugs and also suggesting these features. Don't be shy, report any bugs, annoyances or etc with Neofetch and I'll happily help you out.

Thanks to **[@konimex](https://github.com/konimex)** for all of his contributions this release. :)

## Contributors

## Ascii

![ubuntu](https://u.teknik.io/zILeY.png)
<br \><sub>Old Ubuntu Logo vs New Ubuntu Logo</sub>
- Updated Ubuntu logo to the latest version.
  - You can use the old logo by launching neofetch with `--ascii_distro ubuntu_old` or by changing `$ascii_distro` to `ubuntu_old` in your config file.
- `--ascii_colors` no longer changes text colors.
- Added ascii art for Ubuntu-Budgie.
  - You can use the ascii art by launching Neofetch with `--ascii_distro ubuntu-budgie` or by changing `$ascii_distro` to `ubuntu-budgie` in your config file.
- Fixed bug causing RFRemix to use the incorrect ascii art.

## Screenshots

Neofetch will now automatically find and use whatever screenshot tool is available on your system. The screenshot tool is no longer hardcoded and you don't have to edit your config file to specify what program to use.

On Haiku and macOS, Neofetch will use the built-in tools to take screenshots. On systems with an X server Neofetch will look for and use the following programs: `scrot`, `maim`, `import (imagemagick)`, `imlib2_grab` and `gnome-screenshot`.

The config option `scrot_cmd` and the commandline flag `--scrot_cmd` are still there for those who want to use custom flags, programs or scripts to take screenshots.
- Automatically use whatever screenshot tool is available.
- Added screenshot support to macOS
- Added screenshot support to Haiku

## Screenshot Upload
- [teknik.io] Fixed images not uploading with the right filetype.
- Changed default image upload host to `teknik.io`.
  - teknik doesn't compress images whereas imgur does.
  - You can change this back to imgur by using `--image_host imgur` or by editing your config file.


## [2.0] - 2016-12-02

This is the biggest release of Neofetch in a long time. 97 files were changed with 2700~ additions to 2900~ deletions. Although the changelog isn't as interesting this time majority of the script has been rewritten, restructered and cleaned up. Every function and variable name follows a proper naming scheme and a large number of bugs were fixed.

Since this version of Neofetch differs so much from the previous versions expect a 2.0.1 release a few days later to fix any bugs that are found after release.

The ascii file handling was rewritten, ascii art is now stored/read as plain text! All `eval` usage was removed from Neofetch, vim fold markers/comments are no longer enforced and we now run on GNU Hurd, Haiku and more.

When I was rewriting parts of the script I thought to myself; Neofetch is using the bash shebang and does depend on bash so why not take full advantage of the features bash has to offer? All tests were changed from `[` to `[[`, arithmetic tests now use `(())` and C style for loops are used where possible.

All of the config file documentation was rewritten and multiple wiki pages were created to hopefully make using/configuring Neofetch easier than ever before. You can see the wiki here: [Neofetch Wiki](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/wiki)

Some of the config options/arguments were renamed/changed and Neofetch will warn you on run if you're using deprecated options (`neofetch -v`). For this release Neofetch **will** include backwards compatibility with the old config file but I'd like to remove this stuff in ~~2.1~~ 3.0. I recommend using this release with a fresh config file so that you can make use of the new documentation.

I say this every release; This changelog is incomplete, for a full list of changes take a look through the commit history. Neofetch now has an unspoken commit style so reading the commit history won't hurt as much as it used to.

Thanks to all of the contributors this time around, you guys are a big help and I really appreciate your work towards making Neofetch better and better each release. :)

## [1.9] - 2016-11-01

This change log won't cover everything that's changed. Have a look through the commit
history for more info.

There were a lot of major changes made to how things work in this release so I'm expecting
bugs/things not working for people. Expect a 1.9.X release.

I'm also looking for neofetch screenshots for the Readme, see this issue: [#405](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/issues/405)

Thanks to everyone below who contributed, it's nice to see some new faces too. :)

    - Note: I recommend installing `termux` from the Play Store or F-Droid. Termux provides you with a fully
      working Linux environment, doesn't require root acess and includes all dependencies.
    - Note2: Neofetch will be packaged in `termux` thanks to **[@konimex](https://github.com/konimex)**

**Fixed rendering issues in URxvt when using an XFT font.**

![scrot](https://i.sli.mg/6qp9Cg.png)

This was first thought to be an issue between URxvt and W3m-img and I apologize for immediately closing bug reports and dismissing comments about this.

I spent yesterday trying to fix this issue and found out that launching neofetch with `--bold off`
reduced the rendering problems. I did more digging and found out that removing all text formatting fixes the issue entirely. I later found out that adding a single unformatted character before the formatted text fixed the issue while keeping the formatting the same.

I opened up this PR https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/pull/358 which added options to enable a border between the image and the text to fix the issue. **[@konimex](https://github.com/konimex)** later commented informing me that we could just use a `zero-width space` to fix the issue and that we didn't need a new function/args/ugly border. doh

The final fix was as simple as adding a zero-width space before the info, here's the commit.

https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/commit/3e9c3d648cb4c6f0d5fe5f0b96f9e29429af39d9

**Removed hard dependency on `\033[14t`**

Neofetch no longer requires a terminal emulator that supports `\033[14t` this means that neofetch now works in Konsole. Instead of using the escape sequence users now have three options for getting the terminal size in pixels.
- `xdotool`
- `xwininfo` + `xprop`
- `xwininfo` + `xdpyinfo`

Neofetch will detect whatever combination you have insalled and use these programs.

Note: `\033[14t` is still supported, if images already work for you then you don't have to install anything else.
- [w3m-img] Draw the image twice to fix rendering issues in Konsole.
- [w3m-img] Fix cursor position when using `yoffset`.
- [w3m-img] Add `-bg` support with the new option `--bg_color`.
  - `neofetch --bg_color blue` will make the background behind the image blue.
  - Note: The background color is only visible behind transparent parts of the image.
- If the terminal width is found as `0`, fallback to ascii mode.

## Ascii
- Bold ascii art by default.
- Fixed incorrect prompt location when using `ascii_logo_size small`.
- Fixed incorrect colors used on light terminals.
- Update Void Linux ascii art. **[@ncmprhnsbl](https://github.com/ncmprhnsbl)**
- Update Solus ascii art.

## Info

**Distro**<br \>
- Expanded `distro_shorthand` to macOS, BSD and Solaris. **[@konimex](https://github.com/konimex)**

  - `logical`: Show all virtual cores (hyperthreaded).
  - `physical`: Only show physical cores.
- [Linux] Added support for showing CPU temperature.
  - Added new option called `cpu_temp`.
  - Note: This is disabled by default and can be enabled by changing the value of `cpu_temp` in your config to `on`.
- [macOS] Print physical cores instead of hyper-threaded cores. **[@iandrewt](https://github.com/iandrewt)**
- [iOS] Rewrite CPU function.

**GPU**
- [iOS] Rewrite GPU function.
- [Linux] Rewrite GPU function.
  - Neofetch also caches the info until reboot.

**Terminal and Terminal Font**<br \>
- [Linux] Use `/proc/$PPID/comm` instead of parsing `ps`.
- Uppercase first letter of `termfont` output.
- Don't print broken output of busybox's `ps`.

## [1.8] - 2016-10-02

This version of neofetch is vastly different from the previous versions and this
changelog won't cover everything that's changed. Have a look through the commit
history for more info.

There were a lot of major changes to how things work in this release so I'm expecting
bugs/things not working for people. Depending on what comes up we my release a few 1.8.X
versions.

This changelog is a bit of a mess this time around and I apologize but it should at least
get the message across.

Android support didn't make it into this release as it requires testing on more devices.
If you've got a device running android and would like to help test out the branch, check
out the open PR here: [#322](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/pull/322)

This release also saw a lot more contributors which makes me really happy. Thanks to those
below for helping out. :)

### Error Messages

Neofetch now supports displaying error messages and saving a verbose log for
troubleshooting.

![log](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmeTWGKozY79zcxbrgXueyTRfQcTUe7ZmDqLv4ASgJB4G4)
- Added `-v` to print error messages to stdout.
- Added `-vv` to print a verbose log to stdout. [1]

[1] Use `neofetch -vv 2> file` to save a verbose log for bug reporting.

### Info
- Rewrote most BSD info functions, they're now much smaller and work on more
  BSD distros.

**prin**
- Format changes to fix issues with colons in string. This change also makes
  `prin` use the same args as `info`.

``` sh
# OLD Format
prin "Subtitle: Text goes here"

# NEW Format
prin "Subtitle" "Text goes here"
```

**Title**
- Made title faster by using `$HOSTNAME` when available.

**Underline**
- Fixed bug with `--underline on/off` not working.
- Underlining is no longer hardcoded to title length meaning you can now
  underline any part of the output and the length will match.
- `$underline` was renamed to `$underline_enabled`.

``` sh
# OLD Variable
underline="on"

# NEW Variable
underline_enabled="on"
```

**Distro**
- Fix arch issues with ARM cpus.
- We now use `uname -m` to get the arch instead of hardcoding `x86`.
- Moved distro detection to a function called `getdistro`.
- Fixed issue with `ascii_distro` not working.

**CPU**
- Fixed issues when cpu speed was < 1Ghz
- Cleanup of CPU function.
- Don't print `Dual-Core` or `Quad-Core` in CPU output.

**GPU**
- [Linux] More GPU substitutions for AMD cards.
- Added BSD support using `glxinfo`.

**Memory**
- [Linux / Windows] Use `memavail` if available for a more accurate output.

**Packages**
- Package count now works when the user has multiple package managers installed.
  For example, if the user has both `dpkg` and `pacman` installed the function will
  add up the packages from both package managers to get a grand total. (`dpkg pkgs` + `pacman pkgs`)

**Uptime**
- Fixed various issues with OS X and BSD.

**Desktop Environment**
- [ Linux ] Fallback to using `xprop` if `$XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` is empty.
- Use `$de` instead of `$XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` for wallpaper and theme detection.
- Fixed xprop bug with DE detection when X wasn't running.
- Don't assume that user is using MATE if marco wm is detected.

**Window Manager Theme**
- Fixed bug when `$de` was unset.

**Color Blocks**
- Fixed bug when the blocks wrap a line causing a large white strip to appear.

### Ascii
- Added KDE neon ascii art.
- Added small OpenBSD ascii art.
  - Credit goes to ufetch.
- Reduced the size of NetBSD's ascii art.
- [Windows 8/8.1] Use modern windows ascii art.

### Colors
- Fixed bug with `--colors` not working with all 256 terminal colors.
- `--colors 7` now uses the color white. [1]
- `--colors fg` now uses the foreground color. [1]

[1] Neofetch tried to be smart before by assuming that the foreground color
would be white or black. This caused issues for those setting the foreground
color to red or etc. This change adds a new value for `--colors` and `colors=()`
called `fg` which will set the color to your foreground color.

### Progress Bars
- The default progress bar look was changed to `[=====-----]` instead of `━━━━━━━━━━`
  fix issues with older systems.
- You can now enable/disable a border around the progress bars with `progress_border`.

``` sh
# $progress_border on
[=====-----]

# $progress_border off
=====-----
```
- You can now individually set the progress bar characters by using
  `progress_char_elapsed` and `progress_char_total`. This means that you can
  have a seperate character for the elapsed and total portions of the bar.

``` sh
# Examples with $progress_border on

# Elapsed: =
# Total: -
[=====-----]

# Elapsed: .
# Total: " "
[.....     ]

# Elapsed: /
# Total: " "
[/////     ]
```


## [1.6] - 2016-04-01

# Neofetch 1.6

Another ~~week~~ another release of Neofetch.

This release focused on cleanup, bug fixes and optimization. Neofetch
is now much much faster than last release and more bug free than ever
before!

This release surprisingly didn't break much at all, see the latest entry in
the wiki page `Following HEAD`.

https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/wiki/Following-HEAD

  allow us to speed up the script by caching info that won't change for a<br \>
  long period of time like the CPU/GPU. [1]
- Fixed a locale issue when `LC_ALL` is unset on the user's system.
- Change all usage of `$HOME/.config` to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` with a fallback to `$HOME/.config`.

## [1.3] - 2016-02-26

# Fetch 1.3

Hey guys,

This update brought some breaking changes, see this wiki page for what you'll
need to update in your config file.

https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/wiki/Following-HEAD

We're in the middle of renaming 'fetch' to something else as there are
already other programs using the name and we don't appear in any searches.

You can help out by voting in our poll here:

http://strawpoll.me/6894425
- Fetch now supports **bash 3.0+**.
- More cleanup
- The text is now by default colored according to your distro's logo.
- Removed `$*_color` variables/flags in favour of a general `$colors`
  variable/flag. See my writeup here: **https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/pull/96**

### Image
- You no longer need to set the font_width value, your font size
  is now calculated by fetch automatically.
- Image sizing now takes terminal height into account.
- `--size` now also takes a percentage as a value, for example.

``` sh
# Image takes up 70% of the terminal size.
fetch --size 70%

This new release comes with a few config breaking changes, see this wiki page
for info on how you can workaround the issues.

https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/wiki/Following-HEAD
- Fetch now has a **gitter** chatroom. [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/dylanaraps/fetch.svg)](https://gitter.im/dylanaraps/fetch?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)
- Fixed text padding when the user didn't have the locale `en_US.UTF8` installed.

## [1.1] - 2016-02-06

# Fetch 1.1 changelog

Over the past 10~ days over **190** more commits have been pushed to master and the
script has had some big changes. Thanks to everyone who has contributed, you've been
a big help.

![screenfetch mode](http://i.imgur.com/nW3HiNP.png)
<sup>New screenfetch mode</sup>
- If `w3m` or `imagemagick` aren't installed we gracefully fallback to ascii mode.
- Automatically find the `w3m-img` path and fallback to ascii mode if not found. [1]
- Fix padding escape codes on BSD systems.
- Swap escape codes from `\e` to `\033` for consistency.
- We only move the cursor to the bottom of the terminal in w3m/iterm2 rendering modes.
- Cursor position is now dynamic in ascii mode based on the height of the ascii and info text.
- If images and ascii are off, don't clear the terminal
- The script now exits correctly instead of always exiting with status code `1`
- If the script exits for any reason, unhide the cursor.
- Removed duplicate blocks inside `getcpu` and `getmemory`.
- Removed `--colors` as it was apparently broken from day 1.
- Usage has been reformatted so that every flag has a value.

[1] Setting `$w3m_img_path` will make the script look there first.

### Image
- Added support for displaying ascii art inside of text files.
- Added "screenfetch mode" which will display your distro's ascii art next to the info. [1]
- Added `--ascii_distro` to choose which distro's ascii logo to display.
- Added `--ascii_colors` and `$ascii_colors` which allow you to change the colors of the ascii art
  and distro logos. [2]
- Added `--size` and `$image_size` to set the image size in pixels.
- Rename `--shuffledir` and `$shuffledir` to `shuffle_dir`.
- Rename `--imgtempdir` and `$imgtempdir` to `thumbnail_dir`
- Removed `--split_size` and `$split_size` as they were weird and confusing to use.
- Default thumbnail directory is now `$HOME/.cache/thumbnails/fetch`. Thanks @tudurom
- If `--image` and `--ascii` are left empty we fallback to ascii distro mode.

Example usage of ascii from file:

``` sh
fetch --ascii "path/to/ascii" --ascii_color 2

```

[1] **[How do I enable screenfetch mode?](http://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch#how-do-i-enable-screenfetch-mode)**
[2] `ascii_colors` takes a range of colors which allows you to color every aspect of
distro and OS ascii art. For custom art the script will color the entirety of it using
the first value of `ascii_colors`. If `ascii_colors` is left empty, color will be disabled.

### Config file
- Fetch now has a config file that you can share with people and keep between
  script versions! [1]
- Added `--config` and `$config_file` to specify a custom config location.
- Added `--config off`, `--config none` and `$config` to enable / disable config files
  at launch or in script.

[1] https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch#using-the-config-file

### Makefile
- Fetch now has a make file due to the increasing number of files,
  this allows the script to be easily installed and uninstalled on
  systems it isn't packaged for yet! [1]

[1] The script will still work just fine on its own, you'll just be missing
the distro ascii art and the automatic config creation.

### Packages
- Fetch now has a Gentoo/Funtoo e-build courtesy of **@z1lt0id**

### Stdout
- Added `stdout` mode which allows you to fetch info in a plain text format that works
  with lemonbar and in your scripts. You can use it by launching fetch with `--stdout` to print all
  functions enabled in your `printinfo` function. You can selectively print functions by passing
  arguments to `--stdout` like so:

``` sh
# Print the output of all info functions enabled in printinfo
fetch --stdout

# Print the output of memory
fetch --stdout memory

# Print the output of memory and disk
fetch --stdout disk

# Print the output of all functions excluding x
fetch --stdout --disable kernel packages gtktheme

```
- Added `--stdout_separator` and `$stdout_separator` which takes a string and adds it
  as a separator between the output.
- Added `--stdout_title` and `$stdout_title` which allow you to toggle the `title@hostname`
  from appearing in the output.
- Added `--stdout_subtitles` which allow you to toggle the `Info:` titles from appearing in
  the output.

``` sh
# Hiding subtitles
fetch --stdout --stdout_subtitles off

# Custom separator
fetch --stdout disk gpu --stdout_separator "  |  "

```

**NOTE:** `stdout_subtitles` and `stdout_title` only work when `--stdout` is used on its own
without any args.

### Info
- You can now display info without a subtitle. eg. `info memory`
- Added `--disable` which allows you to stop an info line from appearing at launch.
- Added `--underline` and `$underline` which allow you to toggle visibility of the
  underline at launch and in your config.

``` sh
# Stop cpu, gpu, disk and shell functions from being called
fetch --disable cpu gpu disk shell
```

**Kernel:** Added `--kernel_shorthand` and `$kernel_shorthand` to print less or more kernel info
**Window Manager:** Added support for `$XINITRC`
**GTK:** Fix incorrect GTK3 theme being displayed
**CPU:** `cpu_shorthand`: New substitutions
**GPU:** `[Linux]` Count the number of identical GPUs. eg. `Nvidia Geforce GTX 970 x 2`
**Memory:** `[Mac OS X]` Added wired memory to memory usage.

**Distro:**
- Added support for showing OS architecture. eg `Arch Linux x86_64`, `Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit` [1]
- Mac OS X: Added support for showing Max OS X build version. [2]
- Windows: Distro now displays Windows edition. eg. `Windows 7 Ultimate`

[1] You can toggle this using `--os_arch` and `$os_arch`.
[2] You can toggle it using `--osx_buildversion` and `$osx_buildversion`.

**Shell:**
- Added `--shell_version` and `$shell_version` to hide/show your shell's version.
- Added `--shell_path` and `$shell_path` to hide/show the path to your shell

**Birthday:**
- Added `birthday` which prints the age of your OS install.
- Added `--birthday_shorthand` and `$birthday_shorthand` to shorten/lengthen
  the output of birthday.
- Added `--birthday_time` and `$birthday_time` to show/hide the time in the output.

**Battery:**
- Added `battery` which prints the battery usage percentage for each battery
  in your system.
- Linux: Added `battery_num` which allows you to choose which battery to display,
  it also takes the value `all` which will print all batteries line by line.
- Linux: Added `battery_shorthand` which when set to `on` prints each battery on the
  same line like so:

``` sh
# battery_shorthand="on"
Battery: 10%, 5%, 67%

# battery_shorthand="off"
Battery0: 10%
Battery1: 5%
Battery2: 67%

# If there's only a single battery in the system
# we ommit the numbered title.
Battery: 10%
```
- **NOTE:** This currently doesn't support BSD systems as we have no one to help us test

## [1.0] - 2016-01-27

# Fetch 1.0

There have been over **260** commits to master since I last made a release
and the script is at a point now where I can say that it's feature complete
so I'm releasing 1.0. The script now supports many more OS/distros and has
had lots of bug fixes, changes and features added.

I'm probably missing a bunch of stuff from this changelog so if i've
forgotten anything, let me know!

I'm also slowly adding pages to the wiki so check it out!

# Here's what's new:
- Added full support for **Windows**, **BSD** and **Mac OS X**.
- Fetch is now MIT licensed
- Dropped the `.sh` from the filename and title.
- Dropped support for `mksh` so we can support some `bash` only features.
- Cleanup of everything
- Added `--prompt_height` and `$prompt_height` to fix the script going<br \>
  offscreen due to multi-line shell prompts. This option should be set to<br \>
  your prompt height in lines.
- The script now supports bash **4.0**. It turns out that we only<br \>
  supported bash **4.3**
- Restore cursor and clear screen on ctrl+c.
- Swap `tput` cmds for `ansi escape sequences` where possible.
- Added folds to make the script easier to navigate in *vim.
- Added `-F` to grep where possible for a speedup where possible.
- Fix whitespace issues with different distros.
- Remove uneeded `$` symbols.
- Remove double negative tests.
- Added note about needing `procps` or `procps-ng` for uptime support.
- Fix syntax errors in script and readme.
- All vars now use `on/off` instead of `1/0`.
- Quote things that should be quoted.

**Linux:**
- Fix issues with `Elementary OS` and `CentOS`.

**Mac OS X:**
- Added support for other package managers.
- Fix issue with multiple resolutions in `getresolution`

**Windows:**
- Added `getvisualstyle` function to get the current Windows theme.
- Added `choclatey` support to package count.

**BSD:**
- Fix tput commands not working on BSD

## Info:

As of commit 9daacdd the info array at the top of the script has changed
to a regular function. The benefits of this are pretty cool, you can now
use any bash syntax to customize what gets displayed. You could have an
if statment and only print window manager and gtk themes if X is running
or only show current song if there's one playing.

You can see some examples and read more about it here:

https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/wiki/Customizing-Info

<hr>

**All:**
- All functions return `Unknown` or `None` instead of printing nothing.<br \>

**Title:**
- You can now color the `@` symbol in the title using `--at_color`,<br \>
  `$at_color` and `--colors x x x x x x`.

**OS:**
- We now check `lsb_release` before looking inside of files, this fixes<br \>
  detection for some *buntu based distros.
- We now exit if the OS type wasn't detected.

**Window Manager:**
- `wmctrl` is now used by default if found.

**Uptime:**
- Added `--uptime_shorthand` and `$uptime_shorthand` to make the output<br \>
  of `uptime` smaller and prettier.
- Added new `--uptime_shorthand` and `$uptime_shorthand` value<br \>
  called `tiny`. This makes the output even tinier. eg. `1d 10h 32m`

**GTK:**
- Added functions to get GTK Theme, Icons and Font
- Added `--gtk{2,3}` and `$gtk{2,3}` to enable/disable gtk2 or gtk3 from<br \>
  being displayed.
- Added `--gtk_shorthand` and `$gtk_shorthand` to make the output of<br \>
  `gtk*` smaller and prettier.

**Packages:**
- Remove package version and color from `Pacman` output
- All distros are now wildcarded so that version numbers from<br \>
  `lsb_release` are ignored.

**CPU:**
- Added more cpu speed types to `--speed_type` and `$speed_type`.
- Use `cpufreq` when available instead of hardcoding it for specific distros.

**GPU:**

See **[issue #21](https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/issues/21)**
- Added function to get the current Graphics Card.
- Added support for VirtualBox GPU.
- Added `--gpu_shorthand` and `$gpu_shorthand` to make the output of `gpu`<br \>
  smaller and prettier.

**Disk:**

See **[issue #27](https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/issues/27)**
- Added function to get current/total disk usage.

**Song:**
- Added `cmus` support.

## Images:
- Added support for **iTerm2's** image rendering.
- Added `--image_backend` and `$image_backend` to change which program<br \>
  is used to render the images.
- The image is now displayed **before** the text, this fixes image<br \>
  rendering issues with **vte** based terminal emulators.
- Added `$w3m_img_path` to set the location of `w3mimgdisplay`.
- Unified all image options, the new var `$image` takes these<br \>
  values: `wall`, `shuffle`, `path/to/img.png`, `off`.
- Added `shuffle` to image modes. The script can now pick a random<br \>
  image from a specified folder to display. You can pick the shuffle<br \>
  directory with `--shuffle_dir` and `$shuffle_dir`
- Fixed images getting cut off at the top.
- Added image size to filename which allowed us to remove a _really_<br \>
  slow check.

**Wallpaper:**
- Added `nitrogen` and `gsettings` support.
- Added wallpaper support to `Mac OS X` and `Windows`.
- Fix hang when wallpaper isn't found.
- We now check to see that `feh` set the wallpaper.
- Fixed wallpapers with spaces in the filename.
- `wall` is now the default image source.

## Screenshot:

The script can now take a screenshot on script finish. You can use
the flags `--scrot` or `-s` to take a screenshot.

`--scrot` and `-s` can also take a path/filename so you can choose
where and what to name the file at launch.

If left empty `--scrot` and `-s` will use `$scrot_dir` and
`$scrot_name` when saving the screenshot.

By default the script uses `scrot` as the screenshot program.
You can use the launch flag `--scrot_cmd` or the option `$srot_cmd`
to set the program to use to take the screenshot.

## Wiki:

Added `Customizing Info` page which has info/examples about
the new printinfo function.

https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/wiki/Customizing-Info

Added `Customization` which lists all options and their values.

https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/wiki/Customization


## [0.2.1] - 2016-01-04

Here's what's new:
- Mac OS X support (It's done now)
- Resolution Detection (Off by default)
- Song info is now off by default.
- You can now display the image on the right with:
  - `--image_position left/right`
- Fixed bug with multiple colons
- Fixed underlines not being drawn the full width.
- Functions now fallback to "Unknown" instead of printing nothing.
- `getos` now gets os type and `getdistro` gets the distro.
  - This makes it even easier to add other os types.

Here's what I'm working on:
- Finishing OpenBSD support
- Cygwin support

Enjoy


## [0.2] - 2016-01-03

I finished my rewrite!

## Here's what's new:
- The script is now way faster.
- You can now pick what gets displayed and where using an array
  at the top of the script. This also allows you to:
  - underline anything
  - print custom info
  - print a custom title
  - add linebreaks
- Mac OS X support and a base that allows us to add other OS later.
- You can now specify split size.
- Fixed issue with 2 line prompts
- Fixed image not displaying in vte based terminals
- Move all config options to the top of the script
- Moved almost everything to a function.
- Removed wmctrl dependency
- Made variable names more consistent
- Added shell substitution for cpu output. This means
  that the cpu output won't include: (tm) (r) "Processor" "CPU"
- Optimized all get\* functions
- Use variable substitution where possible as it's faster than sed/awk
- Moved crop and smart_crop to crop_mode
- Removed --size and --padding in favor of --split_size

## Here's what I'm currently working on:
- Window support (I'm almost done)
- Option to swap the image and text around
- Imagemagick optimizations
- Cleanup of info array handling
- More info outputs. Now that it's easy to customize what's printed and
  everything is a function we can add optional support for pretty much anything.
  - Resolution
  - GTK themes
  - Terminal Font
  - GPU
  - IP
  - etc

## Issues:
- Uptime doesn't work in OS X yet.
- If the customizable info includes a third colon then it breaks.

I'd love to hear your thoughts.


## 0.1 - 2015-12-31

Changelog:
- Added flag to disable bold text `--nobold`
- Added flag to disable text wrapping `--nowrap`
- Moved to using only printf instead of a mix of echo/printf
- The script now aligns the cursor to the bottom of the
  terminal instead of using a hardcoded amount of newlines
- Image size and padding is now dynamic, the only difference on the user
  side is that instead of setting a long line of spaces as
  padding, you set your font width. This means that you set the
  var once and the script will just work at any window size.
- You can disable dynamic images and go back to the old
  behaviour with by using the `--size` or the in config var.
  $img_auto
- Manual padding now takes a count, so `--padding 10` will pad
  the text 10 spaces.
- tput is now a dependency because we need (tput cols/lines/cup)
  for the dynamic images and it allows us to support more terminals.
- Color block width can now be changed with the flag `--blockwidth`.
  It takes a count like `--padding` so `--blockwidth 10` will make
  the color blocks 10 spaces wide.

Let me know if you're having issues.
